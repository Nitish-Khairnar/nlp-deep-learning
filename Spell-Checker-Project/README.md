### Project Overview

 Have you ever wondered how google autocorrects your spelling and offers accurate suggestions?
When you search anything on the google and you did spelling mistack, it will autoimatically show you the correct spelling or phrase you want to search.
But how does google do that?
In this project we are going to learn how to built the spell checker using the sets of words.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt the text processing, how to convert the data set into lower case, and most importantly calculating the probability of possible word.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Firstly I converted the entire dataset to lower case so as to avoid the double count of same word. Then I created a list of all possible correct words from the file. Suppose you write simple word called beautiful so it will print out all the possible words match with this words.


### Challenges faced

 Creating a function for different list was a little tricky. Because through this lists that we have created, we need to find the probability of each word which is listed in the document. This approach was very new to me. My mentor heped me in gaining insights over here.


### Additional pointers

 Although the functions I have defined here looks little complex at first, they are actually pretty simple. Just because of the nomeclature and wordings it looks complicated.
